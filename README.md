
# res_bess v0.0.1

This repository contains a (public) Python-based model for simulating and sizing Energy Storage Systems (ESS), connected with a Renewable Energy Source behind-the-meter.

## Features

* Simulates ESS operation under various conditions and different regions (example data is included)
* Calculates optimal ESS sizes based on user-defined parameters via a Pareto Front
* Provides visualisations of ESS performance

## Installation & Requirements
To use the model, two main requirements exist:
1. Installing the GLPK solver and compiling it in terminal
    Further instruction can be read in the PDF file titled 'Overview_RESBESS_v001.pdf'
2. Installing the python packages, noted in the file 'requirements.txt'

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
