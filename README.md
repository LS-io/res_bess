This repository contains a Python-based model for simulating and sizing Energy Storage Systems (ESS), connected with a Renewable Energy Source behind-the-meter.

## Features

* Simulates ESS operation under various conditions and different regions (example data is included)
* Calculates optimal ESS size based on user-defined parameters
* Provides visualizations of ESS performance

## Installation & Requirements
To use the model, two main requirements exist:
1. Installing the GLPK solver and compiling it in terminal
    Further instruction can be read in the PDF file titled 'Overview_RESBESS_v001.pdf'
